# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/)
- [Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- For Windows users:
  [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository into your WSL2/Linux/Mac environment
2. Setup SSH keys towards your github
3. Open in VS Code with Dev Containers
4. When prompted, enter your GitHub email and username
5. Install Tailwind CLI (see Tailwind CLI section)
6. Start development:

### Terminal 1

`deno run dev`

### Terminal 2

`deno run tailwind`

## Local Database Access

PgAdmin is available at http://localhost:8080

- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: root

Database credentials:

- Username: root
- Password: root
- Port: 5432

## Environment Variables

This project supports [Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/) for environment
management, which comes pre-installed in the container. After creating a Doppler
account, run the application with:

```bash
doppler run --project <project> --config <environment> -- deno run dev
```

This way you won't have to add any .env files or sdk to the workspace. And for
production you just run the same way with the production environment.

## Tailwind CLI

The setup requires tailwindcli executable to be present in the root of the
project. You can run the following script for the latest version. Read further
in tailwindcss [docs](https://tailwindcss.com/).

```bash
curl -sLO https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/latest/download/tailwindcss-linux-x64
chmod +x tailwindcss-linux-x64
mv tailwindcss-linux-x64 tailwindcli
```

## Components

Components are sourced from
[Hortasha/auro](https://github.com/Hortashaorg/auro).

Add components using:

```bash
deno run comp add <component-name>
```

Browse available components in the
[component catalog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hortashaorg/auro/refs/heads/main/services/app/components/componentMap.json).

Note: The component CLI uses a specific commit version. If you need to update
components, update the commit hash in deno.json's comp task.

kalena.json is already setup in this workspace to work with cli. Feel free to
change the target directory for these components. But you also have to remember
to update the the @comp/ alias in the deno.json file.

# Framework

## Framework Overview

This project uses:

- [Kalena Framework](https://jsr.io/@kalena/framework) for routing and
  permissions
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) for dynamic interactions
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) for client-side state
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling

## Project Structure

```bash
src/
├── pages/       # Navigation routes
├── components/  # UI components (SSR with Alpine.js)
├── sections/    # HTMX-targeted partial updates
├── api/         # HTMX endpoint routes
└── permissions/ # Access control logic
```

## Static Files

The /public directory contains:

- main.css (generated by Tailwind)
- darkmode.js (theme management)

Add your static assets (images, fonts, etc.) to this directory.
